    <p> Atm using this <a href="website.pdf">blank pdf rn \todo</a> instead of a full website.
        Apologies in advance--fwiw I used to have a very swag website via <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, 
        but then I completely forgot how I made it, and it seems it might take at least a few hours to setup and figure out everything again.

        <li>ATTENTION ALL STUDENTS: please do not use <a href="http://libgen.rs">libgen</a>. It is a horrible/awful/terrible site that allows you to conveniently and quickly download free pdfs of all your textbooks with no consequences (I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, you assume responsibility, etc). </li>
