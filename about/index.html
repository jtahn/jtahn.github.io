<!-- currently have this redirect page bc brown grad student page links this page
    https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/graduate-students

    aka the page that has a trailing slash at the end
    ('trailing slash' is the correct term)
    (it's a remnant from when i used jekyll)

    and it seems to create a page for a link with trailing slash at the end: you just add an 'index.html' in the directory
    (bc seems typically: trailing slash at the end, indicates a directory)
